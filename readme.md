This is an app that lets people create and manage a todo list. 

Users will be able to: 
- add items to their todo list, 
- delete items from it, 
- mark items as either done or not done.

Every item in the list will be able to have its own list of steps that can be:
- added,
- deleted, and 
- marked or unmarked as done.

Uses: 
- React/Redux frontend (same as Synthesizer app) 
- Rails API backend (so changes made on the frontend will persist)
